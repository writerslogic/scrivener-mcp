# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing scrivener-mcp, connecting it to Claude, and working with your first Scrivener project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or later** -- check with `node -v`
- **Scrivener 3** -- your project must be a Scrivener 3 `.scriv` package
- **An MCP client** -- Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible client

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g scrivener-mcp
```

The installer automatically detects Claude Desktop and writes the MCP configuration for you. Restart Claude Desktop after installation.

### Manual Configuration

If the automatic setup didn't work, or you're using a different MCP client, add scrivener-mcp to your client's configuration file. See **[MCP Client Setup](./CLIENT_SETUP.md)** for tested, copy-paste snippets for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code (Copilot), including config file paths and verification steps.

You can also run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
npx scrivener-setup
```

The setup wizard detects Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor automatically.

### Other install methods

```bash
# Smithery
npx -y @smithery/cli install scrivener-mcp --client claude

# Direct from GitHub
npm install -g writerslogic/scrivener-mcp
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t scrivener-mcp https://github.com/writerslogic/scrivener-mcp.git
docker run -i --rm -v /path/to/projects:/projects scrivener-mcp
```

Mount your Scrivener projects directory so the server can access them. Inside the container, your projects will be available under `/projects`.

## Verifying the Connection

After restarting Claude Desktop, ask:

> "What Scrivener tools do you have?"

Claude should list six tools: the `project` skill (`open_project`, `get_structure`, `refresh_project`, `close_project`) plus two meta-tools (`list_skills`, `use_skill`). If you don't see the six startup tools, check the troubleshooting section below.

### How skills activate

The server uses progressive tool loading to keep conversations fast by only loading what you need:

1. **At startup:** 6 tools are available -- project management (`open_project`, `get_structure`, `refresh_project`, `close_project`) plus `list_skills` and `use_skill`.
2. **After opening a project:** the `documents` and `search` skills auto-activate, adding read, write, create, delete, move, rename, search, and find tools (roughly 18 more tools).
3. **On demand:** say "activate analysis tools" or Claude calls `use_skill("analysis")` to load additional skill groups. Available on-demand skills:
   - **analysis** -- writing quality, pacing, style, critique, character consistency
   - **compilation** -- compile manuscripts, export, statistics
   - **memory** -- semantic search, analogies, dream mode (HMS)
   - **advanced** -- fractal memory, async job queue, batch operations

You can see all available skills and which are active by asking Claude to call `list_skills`.

## Opening Your First Project

Tell Claude the path to your `.scriv` project:

> "Open my novel at /Users/me/Documents/MyNovel.scriv"

On macOS, a `.scriv` project appears as a single file in Finder but is actually a directory. On Windows, it shows as a normal folder. Either way, point to the top-level `.scriv` directory -- the server finds the `.scrivx` file inside automatically.

**Windows paths** work natively -- no escaping or conversion needed:

> "Open my novel at C:\Users\me\Documents\MyNovel.scriv"

The server handles case-insensitive `.scrivx` file discovery, which is important for projects moved between Mac and Windows (where the filename casing may differ). You can pass either the `.scriv` folder or the `.scrivx` file directly.

Once the project is open, it stays open for the duration of your conversation. You don't need to reopen it between tool calls.

## Working with Your Project

### Exploring the structure

> "Show me the project structure"

Claude calls `get_structure` and returns your binder hierarchy in a compact format -- each entry shows the ID, title, type, and depth. Each document has a UUID that other tools use to identify it.

You can also search for documents by title without browsing the full tree:

> "Find the document called 'The Storm'"

This uses `find_document` internally, which matches against document titles (case-insensitive) and returns up to 20 results with each document's ID, title, type, and path.

You don't need to memorize UUIDs. Just describe what you want and Claude will find the right document:

> "Read the chapter called 'The Storm'"

### Reading and writing

> "Read the first scene in chapter 2"

Claude retrieves the document content as plain text. To see formatting:

> "Read chapter 1 with formatting preserved"

To edit:

> "Write this revised version to the document: [your text]"

Changes are written immediately to the Scrivener project file. Scrivener will see them the next time it reloads or syncs the project.

### Synopses and notes

Every document in Scrivener has a synopsis (the index card text) and notes. You can read and write both:

> "What's the synopsis for chapter 3?"

> "Update the synopsis for chapter 3: Elizabeth arrives at Pemberley and encounters Darcy unexpectedly."

To update many documents at once:

> "Set synopses for all the chapters in Part 1 based on their content."

Claude will read each chapter, generate a synopsis, and batch-update them.

### Searching

> "Search for all mentions of 'lighthouse' in the manuscript"

This searches document content across the entire project (excluding trash). You can also search just the trash:

> "Search the trash for documents about the deleted subplot"

### Metadata

> "Set the label for chapter 5 to 'Revised' and the status to 'Final Draft'"

You can also set custom metadata fields:

> "Add custom metadata to chapter 5: deadline = June 15, reviewer = Sarah"

## Semantic Search

Semantic search, analogies, and dream mode work out of the box without installing any native binary. A built-in JavaScript vector engine handles this automatically using TF-IDF with cosine similarity. You can search by meaning, find analogical relationships between concepts, and use dream mode to surface unexpected connections across your manuscript -- all with zero configuration.

If the optional `holographic-memory` package is installed, the server transparently upgrades to a faster Rust-based engine. You do not need to change any settings or commands; the upgrade is automatic. Most users will never need the native engine -- the JS fallback is fast enough for typical novel-length projects.

## Project Memory

The server maintains persistent memory within your Scrivener project. This data is stored in a `.ai-memory` folder inside the `.scriv` package, so it travels with the project.

### What gets remembered

- **Character profiles** -- names, roles, traits, arcs, relationships
- **Plot threads** -- storylines with status and chapter ranges
- **Style guide** -- tone, voice, POV, tense preferences
- **Writing statistics** -- session logs, word counts, productivity metrics
- **Custom context** -- any key-value data you want to persist

### Setting up memory

At the start of a project, tell Claude about your characters and style:

> "Save a character profile for Marcus: he's the protagonist, a retired detective in his 60s, gruff but compassionate, his arc is about reconnecting with his estranged daughter."

> "Set the style guide: literary fiction, third-person limited, past tense, measured pacing, sparse dialogue."

Claude references this memory when analyzing your writing, making suggestions, and applying enhancements. It's worth spending a few minutes setting this up early -- it makes all the AI features more accurate.

## Where Data is Stored

Everything lives inside your Scrivener project package:

```
MyNovel.scriv/
  MyNovel.scrivx              # Scrivener's project file (XML)
  Files/Data/                  # Your document files (RTF)
  .scrivener-databases/        # SQLite (writing stats, analysis history)
  .ai-memory/                  # Character profiles, plot threads, style guide
```

Nothing is stored globally or sent to external servers. If you move, copy, or share the `.scriv` package, the AI memory comes with it. If you delete the `.ai-memory` folder, you lose the AI context but your Scrivener project is unaffected.

## Environment Variables

These are all optional:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) | `INFO` |
| `SCRIVENER_SKIP_SETUP` | Skip first-run initialization | `false` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI key for AI-powered features | none |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic key for AI-powered features | none |

All core Scrivener operations (read, write, search, structure, metadata) work without any API keys. The AI-powered features (deep analysis, content enhancement, critique) use them when available and fall back to local heuristics when they're not.

### API key auto-discovery

You do not need to manually export your OpenAI key in most cases. The server automatically checks the following locations, in order:

1. The `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (standard `export`)
2. `~/.env`
3. `~/.scrivener-mcp/.env`
4. `~/.config/openai/key`
5. `~/.openai/key`
6. **macOS Keychain** (looks for a generic password with service name `openai-api-key`)

To store your key in the macOS Keychain:

```bash
security add-generic-password -s openai-api-key -a openai -w sk-your-key-here
```

If none of these locations contain a key, you can always fall back to a manual export:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Optional: Neo4j

Neo4j enables character relationship graphs and story structure analysis. It is completely optional -- all other features work without it.

To install:

```bash
# macOS
brew install neo4j

# Other platforms: download from https://neo4j.com/download/
```

Set the following environment variables to connect:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEO4J_URI` | Connection URI (e.g., `bolt://localhost:7687`) |
| `NEO4J_USER` | Neo4j username |
| `NEO4J_PASSWORD` | Neo4j password |

Neo4j is optional. The relationship tools (`add_relationship`, `find_relationships`, `discover_connections`, `character_network`) work without it -- relationships are stored in the Holographic Memory System and available immediately. Connecting Neo4j adds advanced graph analysis (PageRank, shortest path, communities).

## Troubleshooting

**"No project is currently open"**
You need to open a project first. Tell Claude the path to your `.scriv` file.

**JSON parse errors or "Expected ',' or ']'"**
You're running an older version. Update to v0.4.0+ (`npm update -g scrivener-mcp`). Earlier versions had a bug where log output corrupted the MCP protocol stream.

**Tool results seem empty or Claude says "I don't have that information"**
Also a pre-v0.4.0 bug. The server was attaching data in a way that MCP clients couldn't read. Update to the latest version.

**"HHM system not initialized"**
The Holographic Memory System (semantic search, analogies, dream mode) works with a built-in JS engine by default. This error means the HMS has not been loaded yet -- activate the memory skill with `use_skill("memory")` or ask Claude to do so. If `holographic-memory` is installed, it uses the faster Rust engine automatically, but the native module is not required.

**Scrivener shows old content after writing**
Scrivener caches document content in memory. Close and reopen the project in Scrivener, or switch away from the modified document and back, to see changes made by the MCP server.

**Changes aren't saved**
The server writes changes to disk immediately when you use `write_document` or `update_document`. If you want to be certain, ask Claude to "save the project" which explicitly flushes all pending changes.
